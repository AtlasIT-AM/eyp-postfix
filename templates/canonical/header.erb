# TABLE SEARCH ORDER
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked  tables  such  as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
#
#        user@domain address
#               Replace user@domain by address. This form  has  the
#               highest precedence.
#
#               This  is  useful  to clean up addresses produced by
#               legacy mail systems.  It can also be used  to  pro-
#               duce  Firstname.Lastname  style  addresses, but see
#               below for a simpler solution.
#
#        user address
#               Replace user@site by address when site is equal  to
#               $myorigin,  when  site is listed in $mydestination,
#               or  when  it  is  listed  in  $inet_interfaces   or
#               $proxy_interfaces.
#
#               This  form  is  useful for replacing login names by
#               Firstname.Lastname.
#
#        @domain address
#               Replace other addresses in domain by address.  This
#               form has the lowest precedence.
#
#               Note:  @domain  is  a  wild-card. When this form is
#               applied to recipient addresses,  the  Postfix  SMTP
#               server  accepts  mail  for any recipient in domain,
#               regardless of whether that recipient exists.   This
#               may  turn  your  mail  system  into  a  backscatter
#               source: Postfix first accepts mail for non-existent
#               recipients  and  then  tries to return that mail as
#               "undeliverable" to the often forged sender address.
